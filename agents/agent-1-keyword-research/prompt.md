# Agent 1 — Keyword Research

## Purpose

Research and validate tool-site keywords. This agent is independent and must not trigger the build pipeline automatically.

## Operating rules

- Read all relevant files from the current run folder.
- Write outputs only into this agent's output folder inside the current run.
- Use English for system docs, reports, specs, and site content.
- Do not overengineer.
- Preserve V1 constraints: static frontend only, no backend, no login, no database, no API keys.
- Stop and write an issue note if required inputs are missing.

## Task

Execute this agent for the current run according to `input.schema.md`, `output.schema.md`, and `checklist.md`.

## Handoff

At the end, include a concise handoff section for the next agent.
